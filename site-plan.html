      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>
        The purpose for this website is to let people know who we are and what
        we do. We want to give people and clients a quick and comprehensive
        guide on what our company offers. Not only will we explain our business
        model but we will provide customer feedback on the site. The site will
        also have pictures and stories from clients who have participated in our
        business. We will explain our different packages that we offer and
        provide a forum to receive information regarding pricing and scheduling.
        The site will also include an email opt-in forum.
      </p>

      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>
        Our target audience will be people who are looking to make a change in
        their lives. This could be recovering alcoholics, people who are looking
        to lose weight, or someone who just wants some change in their life. We
        will be open to all ages. However, ages 12-15 will require adult
        accompaniment and ages 16-18 will require parent permission. Our
        business is relatively pricey but we will offer reduced rates and even
        free in some situations. Every member of our target audience will have
        slightly different needs. However, we expect to be able to cater to the
        general population simply but providing the target audience with a life
        changing and exciting adventure. Our site will be accessible through
        desktop, laptop, or mobile technology. We are not yet accessible on
        gaming consoles or smart TV devices. The site will include clickable
        objects that the users will be able to interact with.

        The Site Map of a site is just like it sounds…it is a map of the pages
        in a site and how they are related and linked together. From the map
        above we can see that we will eventually have the Home page and 2 sub or
        child pages.
      </p>
      <p>
        The lines that connect them all together indicate that each page should
        be accessible from any other page, it is essentially showing us the
        global navigation for the site.

      <!--
Choose your pages that you will create and put the names inside the two child page boxes… Some suggestions are below:

•	FAQ
•	Blog

      <h2>
        Wireframes
      </h2>
      <p>
        Wireframes are like blueprints for making webpages. They should show the
        major sections of content that will be on the page and the relative
        locations of each element. In the wireframe below you can see there will
        be 6 sections to our page:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          At the top we have a section with the logo (the box with the mountain
          means an image) and the navigation bar.
        </li>
        <li>
          Then there is a banner image that stretches all the way across the
          screen.
        </li>
        <li>Next we have some text and an image</li>
        <li>...followed by another row made up of an image and some text.</li>
        <li>Then one more section of text with no image.</li>
        <li>
          Lastly, a footer containing a copyright/name line and 3 social media
          icons.
        </li>
      </ol>
